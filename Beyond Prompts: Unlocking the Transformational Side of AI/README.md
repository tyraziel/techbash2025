# Beyond Prompts: Unlocking the Transformational Side of AI

## Abstract

Most people treat Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) like a vending machine: insert token, push button, get snack. That’s fine for quick answers, but it misses the real opportunity. What happens when AI is treated not just as a tool, but as a partner or sidekick?

In this talk, we’ll go beyond transactional prompting and explore the transformational shift: how conversations, continuity, and symbolism can unlock better results and reshape the way we work with AI. Expect a mix of laughs, practical takeaways, and stories you’ll be quoting long after the session ends.

By the end, you’ll have a fresh framework for collaborating with AI that makes complex concepts approachable, keeps your creativity at the center, and turns “just tokens” into something much more.

Attendee Takeaways:

1) Code Smarter: Move beyond vending-machine prompting with conversational techniques that yield richer, more reliable results.

2) Connect Deeper: Treat LLMs as collaborators by leveraging continuity, narrative, and symbolism to shape better outcomes.

3) Construct Confidently: Apply a practical framework for human–AI collaboration that emphasizes judgment, creativity, and guardrails.

4) Communicate Clearly: Use accessible stories and analogies to explain AI concepts to colleagues, teams, and non-technical audiences.
