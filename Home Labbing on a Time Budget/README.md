# Home Labbing on a Time Budget

## Abstract

Building a home lab is often seen as a financial challenge, but another constraint for many enthusiasts isn’t money - it’s time. In this talk, we’ll explore how to stand up and maintain a functional home lab while working within a strict time budget. We'll focus on core services like DNS, Certificate Management, Identity and Access Management (IDAM) and automation to streamline setup and maintenance. By leveraging simple, effective solutions - without relying on cloud-based alternatives - you’ll learn how to get the most out of your lab without it becoming a second job, or disrupting the rest of your home network. Whether you're an IT professional, a student, or a hobbyist, this session will provide practical strategies to help you optimize your time while still building a powerful and useful home lab.
